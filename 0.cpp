/*
Problem:
Choose k entries from n numbers. Make sure each number is selected with the probability of k/n
Basic idea:
Choose 1, 2, 3, ..., k first and put them into the reservoir.
For k+1, pick it with a probability of k/(k+1), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
For k+i, pick it with a probability of k/(k+i), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
Repeat until k+i reaches n.

Prove:
i is the number of numbers so far
for i = k + 1:
    for the ith item to stay is p = k/i
    for the prev item to stay is p = 1 - (k/i) * (1/k) = (i-1)/i = k/i
for i = j + 1, j > k;
    assume that p(each item to stay when i = j) = k/j
    then for the j+1 item to stay is k/(j+1)
    for prev any item to stay is:
        p(already stayed) * p(not replaced)
      = k/j * (1 - k/(j+1) * 1/k) = (k/jï¼‰* (j/j+1) = k/(j+1) = k/i
